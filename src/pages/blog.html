      <h3>Why I Write</h3>
      I believe that knowledge grows when shared. This blog is my space to
      document my journey, break down complex ideas, and explore solutions to
      real-world problems. Whether it’s technical insights, lessons learned,
      or new perspectives, my goal is to create content that sparks curiosity,
      encourages learning, and adds value to others in their journey. It’s not
      just about what I build—it’s about understanding, improving, and sharing
      that process with others.
